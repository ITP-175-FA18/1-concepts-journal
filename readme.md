# 1-concepts-journal Instructions

The purpose of this journal is to continue honing your reflection and web search skills. Getting stuck on a problem or concept is very common when learning to program. Finding more resources that help you get over that hump is a critical skill.

While a lot of the steps in this assignment are similar to the last journal, there are some extra steps. To complete this assignment:

1. Join the [`1-concepts-journal` slack channel][2]
1. In that Slack channel, you will see a link that will take you to Github Classroom
1. Accept the `1-concepts-journal` assignment and Github will create a version of the repository for you.
1. Once this step is complete, visit [the Github homepage][1] and you should now see `ITP-175-FA18/1-concepts-journal` in the list on the left under Repositories.

    **Reach out to the professor if you have issues getting to this stage. Do NOT Wait!!**

1. Click the `ITP-175-FA18/1-concepts-journal` repository and you will see a copy of these assignment instructions.
1. Click the green `Create new file` button on this page and name it `journal.md`.
1. In `journal.md` write two lists. One for the things you understand most confidently, and another for the things you are struggling with.
1. Pick one of the items from the things you are struggling with and use the web to find a resource that helps you understand it better.

    If you're having trouble finding a resource, check out these tips on [refining web searches][3] and [filtering search results][4]

1. Add the URL of the resource you found and a statement about what made it helpful to you to your `journal.md`.
1. Scroll down and you'll see a section called `Commit new file`. In the smaller textbox type, `create journal.md` and select the Commit directly to the `master` branch option.
1. Click the green `Commit new file` button.
